Warm up questions
Please discuss the following questions with your pair partner:

What is Bootstrap?

What can we do with Bootstrap?

How can we download Bootstrap?

What does the Bootstrap folder contain? Could you explain the purpose of every file?

How can we add Bootstrap to a project? Could you explain the difference between these options?

What is the Bootstrap grid?

How many columns can fit in each grid row?

What is the difference between the classes col-md-4 and col-sm-4?

What does it mean offsetting columns in Bootstrap?


Basic Exercise | Bootstrap Installation
Let's create an HTML document and name it  bootstrap-b1.html. Add some content to this document. If you don't have inspiration for the text you can insert Lorem Ipsum text. Divide the text into few paragraphs. Check the result in your browser. Now, download the Bootstrap framework and add it to your bootstrap-b1.html document. Check the result in the browser again, can you see any difference?   


Basic Exercise | Bootstrap CDN Installation
You've already inserted the Bootstrap framework from the downloaded file, now it is time to use Bootstrap's CDN. You can use the same example from the previous exercise and add the Bootstrap CDN. Check the result in the browser.



Basic Exercise | Bootstrap classes

Now we can create an HTML document, name this document bootstrap-day1-b2.html. We've already summarized what we've learned so far (html, css, js) in the "Basic Bootstrap Template" section of the Pre-Work, now we can use the same template and extend it. You need to include Bootstrap to this template - you can choose the best way to do that. Try to add Lead, Emphasis and Abbreviations classes to this template. Be creative and try to find some other Bootstrap classes on https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/

Intermediate Exercise | Basic Grid
Please create a new HTML document and name it bootstrap-i1.html. You can use the same content from the previous example(Basic Exercise 1 and 2), but this time divide the text content into 7 paragraphs (yes, an uneven number!)

For large screens, use a grid of three rows with three columns for the content.  Wrap the text paragraphs in a way that every paragraph occupies a single grid element. On extra-small screens, each paragraph should be shown as a single column in a row.

Now try to change the way these paragraphs are shown on medium and small screens. Feel free to experiment with the number of columns per row.    


Intermediate Exercise | Basic Grid 2
Create a new HTML document and name it bootstrap-i2.html. You can use Lorem Ipsum as a text filler, but this time divide the text content into 13 paragraphs. Wrap the text paragraphs in a way that every paragraph occupies a single grid element.

You should end up with a grid of five rows and three columns on large screen. On medium screens, each row should have two paragraphs/columns. On small screens you should have two columns per row and on extra small screens you should have one column per row.
