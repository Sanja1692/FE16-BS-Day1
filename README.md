Basic
Warm up questions
Please discuss the following questions with your pair partner:

What is Bootstrap?

What can we do with Bootstrap?

How can we download Bootstrap?

What does the Bootstrap folder contain? Could you explain the purpose of every file?

How can we add Bootstrap to a project? Could you explain the difference between these options?

What is the Bootstrap grid?

How many columns can fit in each grid row?

What is the difference between the classes col-md-4 and col-sm-4?

What does it mean offsetting columns in Bootstrap?


Basic Exercise | Bootstrap Installation
Let's create an HTML document and name it  bootstrap-b1.html. Add some content to this document. If you don't have inspiration for the text you can insert Lorem Ipsum text. Divide the text into few paragraphs. Check the result in your browser. Now, download the Bootstrap framework and add it to your bootstrap-b1.html document. Check the result in the browser again, can you see any difference?   


Basic Exercise | Bootstrap CDN Installation
You've already inserted the Bootstrap framework from the downloaded file, now it is time to use Bootstrap's CDN. You can use the same example from the previous exercise and add the Bootstrap CDN. Check the result in the browser.



Basic Exercise | Bootstrap classes

Now we can create an HTML document, name this document bootstrap-day1-b2.html. We've already summarized what we've learned so far (html, css, js) in the "Basic Bootstrap Template" section of the Pre-Work, now we can use the same template and extend it. You need to include Bootstrap to this template - you can choose the best way to do that. Try to add Lead, Emphasis and Abbreviations classes to this template. Be creative and try to find some other Bootstrap classes on https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/

Intermediate Exercise | Basic Grid
Please create a new HTML document and name it bootstrap-i1.html. You can use the same content from the previous example(Basic Exercise 1 and 2), but this time divide the text content into 7 paragraphs (yes, an uneven number!)

For large screens, use a grid of three rows with three columns for the content.  Wrap the text paragraphs in a way that every paragraph occupies a single grid element. On extra-small screens, each paragraph should be shown as a single column in a row.

Now try to change the way these paragraphs are shown on medium and small screens. Feel free to experiment with the number of columns per row.    


Intermediate Exercise | Basic Grid 2
Create a new HTML document and name it bootstrap-i2.html. You can use Lorem Ipsum as a text filler, but this time divide the text content into 13 paragraphs. Wrap the text paragraphs in a way that every paragraph occupies a single grid element.

You should end up with a grid of five rows and three columns on large screen. On medium screens, each row should have two paragraphs/columns. On small screens you should have two columns per row and on extra small screens you should have one column per row.

Advanced Exercise | Offsetting columns


Let's play a little bit with offsetting columns. Please create a new HTML document and name it bootstrap-a1.html. This time create at least three rows (you can create more rows if you want):

The first row should have two columns on large screens 1 unit wide - represented on the image as Row 1, on medium screens these two columns should be 2 units wide.  Set the offset accordingly to get the result as it represented on the image below (Row 1). You can set the background color for the first row to red.  

The second row should have three columns on large screens 2 units wide - set the offset to get the result as it represented on the image below. You can set the background color of the second row to yellow.

The third row should have three columns on large screens, the first column should be 2 units wide, the second column should be 6 units wide and the third column should be 3 units wide - set the offset to get the result as it represented on the image below. You can set the background color of the second row to gray.

All columns should have a white background.     

Now itâ€™s time to do your final Challenge for the first day in Bootstrap. Let's create something different from our previous examples. You are familiar with YouTube as a user, now you should try to create the same grid for your template as you can see on YouTube's website. You can open YouTube and see how it responds to different screen sizes. On the images below you can see the page structure that we need to achieve. First, create the structure that you can see on the image, and later, if you want, you can try to insert better styles or graphics.
